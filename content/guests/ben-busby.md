### Developer

> Originally an aspiring musician, Ben begrudgingly pursued computer science in college and eventually got hooked on programming. He currently works as a freelance developer, primarily in the aerospace industry, working on solutions for controlling unmanned aircraft in demanding atmospheric environments. Ben maintains a number of open source projects as well â€” including Whoogle Search, a privacy respecting metasearch engine.  
> Outside of software development, Ben also dabbles in music production and game design.
