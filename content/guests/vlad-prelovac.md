### CEO of Kagi Inc.

> Hello,  
> I am Vladimir Prelovac (pronounced "prel-oh-wats" - or simply call me Vlad), a dad and builder of things, originally from Yugoslavia. After going through two wars in my youth, I decided enough is enough and decided to move to US with my family and we now reside in San Francisco Bay Area. Sadly, the country I was born in does not exist anymore.  
> My youth was deeply intertwined with a passion for software, computer games, physics, and astronomy. I began my journey in technology in 1983 with a Commodore 64 and Elite (the game that opened my then 7 year old mind). Perhaps the nerdiest highlight of my life was meeting Elite creator David Braben to discuss terraforming Mars by driving a comet into it.  
> Since 2004, I begun running bootstrapped ventures as a founder. In my most recent corporate role, I had the privilege of serving as VP of Product at GoDaddy (2016-2018), which I joined following the acquisition of ManageWP.  
> I find immense joy in working on ambitious, often audacious product ideas that push the boundaries of possibile. Since 2018, I have been fortunate to dedicate myself to Kagi, a project focused on creating a novel search engine and web browser. This endeavor is my tribute to my three children, striving to make the web more humane and a friendlier place for them.
