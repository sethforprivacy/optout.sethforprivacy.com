### CTO Session/Oxen

> Kee is the Chief Technology Officer of Session. In charge of Session’s talented team of in-house and remote developers, Kee leads the technical innovation, vision, and technical research of both the Oxen and Session projects. Kee acquired a keen interest in electronics from a young age — soldering together scavenged electronics parts he found to create remote controlled vehicles and learning his first programming language, Java, by 16. His eager interest in programming led to him studying computer science, where he was first introduced to asymmetric encryption and Bitcoin.  
> 
> Bitcoin fostered a deep interest in blockchain technology, and specifically how blockchain privacy could be improved. Kee became deeply embedded within the cryptography community, leading weekly meetups in Melbourne. Kee authored the whitepapers of Session and Oxen which proposed novel technological systems and software.
