### Co-Founder of Safing

> In 2017, David co-founded Safing with the vision to bring real online privacy to everyone - the technical and non-technical alike.
> Previously, David worked on large scale gaming applications with millions of users. Seeing first hand how the industry gathers and processes intimate user data, he became more and more aware of the importance of privacy, leading him to quit his job for Safing.
