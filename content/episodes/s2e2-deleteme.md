Wondering how to take back control of the data captured by data brokers before you started taking privacy more seriously? This episode, we're sitting down with Rob Shavell, co-founder of DeleteMe to chat about cleaning up the data about you that's been scooped up by data brokers across the internet.

***Note: There were a few small 1-2s segments where Rob's audio cuts out, but shouldn't be too disruptive to the listening experience! Apologies for the minor technical issues in this one.***
