title: About Opt Out
---

Welcome to Opt Out, where I sit down with passionate people to learn why privacy matters to them, the tools and techniques they’ve found and leveraged, and where we encourage and inspire others towards personal privacy and data-sovereignty.

If you like what we’re doing at Opt Out, you can support the podcast by sharing it with your friends, posting about it on social media, suggesting questions and guests for the show, or [supporting the podcast financially](#donations).

Thanks in advance for listening, and I hope you learn as much as I do each episode!
