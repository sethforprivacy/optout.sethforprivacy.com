title: About Opt Out
---

Welcome to Opt Out, where I sit down with passionate people to learn why privacy matters to them, the tools and techniques they’ve found and leveraged, and where we encourage and inspire others towards personal privacy and data-sovereignty.

If you like what we’re doing at Opt Out, you can support the podcast by sharing it with your friends, posting about it on social media, suggesting questions and guests for the show, or [supporting the podcast financially](#donations).

Thanks in advance for listening, and I hope you learn as much as I do each episode!

## Donations

### Monero or Bitcoin/Lightning via BTCPay Server

You can easily donate Bitcoin (on-chain or via Lightning) or Monero via my BTCPay Server instance:

{{< btcpayserver >}}

### Monero via OpenAlias or address

The best way to financially support what I'm doing is by donating Monero, a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, to the OpenAlias `donate@optoutpod.com` or using the QR code below. If you have questions on how to do that, or on Monero in general, please reach out at [seth@optoutpod.com](mailto:seth@optoutpod.com) and I'd be happy to help answer those questions.

Note that if you're viewing this on mobile, simply tap on the QR code.
