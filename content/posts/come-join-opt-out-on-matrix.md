# Introduction

There is a helpful and rapidly growing community forming around the Opt Out podcast and privacy space on Matrix, and this is a simple guide to get you joining in quickly!

As I often talk about on the podcast, finding a community that can support, encourage, and equip you on your privacy journey is vital, and hopefully this will be a helpful start on finding a community that fits you well.

# Why Matrix?

The Opt Out community is focused around Matrix, an open-source, federated, and encrypted chat platform that enables large group chats easily. Matrix has many differenct clients available, and is a rapidly growing protocol and platform for privacy-preserving chats.

You can view Matrix as a modernized IRC or simplified Discord that is improving quickly and is focused on user-privacy and data-sovereignty.

# How to join if you already have a Matrix account

If you're already on Matrix and have an account setup, joining is extremely easy! The following steps will assume you're using Element, the most popular Matrix client, but the overall steps should be similar:

## From the URL

1. Go to <https://matrix.to/#/#optout-general:matrix.optoutpod.com> in your favorite browser (or click the link here!)

2. Select "Continue"

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/join-web.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

3. Select "Continue" under Element (or follow the directions for the app of your choice)

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/join-web2.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

4. Allow the browser tab to open Element

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/open-element.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

5. Click "Join" in Element to confirm

## In Element on desktop

1. Hit the + icon next to "Home" and select "Join public room"

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/join-public-room.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

2. Enter the channel address of "#optout-general:matrix.optoutpod.com" and hit Join

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/join-channel.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

# How to join if you don't yet have a Matrix account

1. Install your preferred Matrix client (I recommend [Element](https://element.io/get-started)) or navigate to <https://chat.optoutpod.com> for a web client
2. Click "Create Account"

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/create-account.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

3. Select a username (this cannot be changed once set, so choose carefully!) and set a strong password

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/create-user.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

4. You will be automatically joined to the main Opt Out channel and can go about joining whatever Matrix channels you'd like from there, and your account is hosted on my Matrix server!

## If creating an account with the Element client or at app.element.io

1. Click "Create Account"

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/create-account.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

2. Click "Edit" at the top right to change homeservers

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/set-homeserver.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

3. Set the homeserver to "optoutpod.com" and click "Continue"

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/optoutpod.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

4. Select a username (this cannot be changed once set, so choose carefully!) and set a strong password

    {{< figure src="/come-join-opt-out-on-matrix/create-user.png" align="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
